# ALGO_VIZ

# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This project visualizes various sorting algorithms using SDL2. The program offers a menu to choose between single or multiple visualizations, change the visualization speed, and exit the program. It supports visualizations for the following sorting algorithms:

1. Selection Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort

## Features

- **Multiple Visualizations**: Choose to visualize one or multiple sorting algorithms simultaneously.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the visualizations (Slow, Medium, Fast).
- **User-Friendly Menu**: Navigate through an intuitive menu to select your options.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (GCC recommended)
- SDL2 library

Usage
Upon running the program, you will be presented with a menu:

One Visualization: Choose a single sorting algorithm to visualize.
Multiple Visualizations: Choose multiple sorting algorithms to visualize simultaneously.
Change Speed: Adjust the speed of the visualizations (Slow, Medium, Fast).
Exit: Exit the program.
Single Visualization
Select this option to visualize a single sorting algorithm. You will be prompted to choose one of the six available sorting algorithms.

Multiple Visualizations
Select this option to visualize multiple sorting algorithms simultaneously. You will be prompted to choose the number of algorithms and then select each algorithm.

Change Speed
Select this option to adjust the speed of the visualizations. You can choose between Slow, Medium, and Fast speeds.

Exit
Select this option to exit the program.
